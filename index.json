We are a student group that promotes the growth of speedcubing in the Bay Area. We hold regular competitions and teach a Decal.\nWe have weekly meetings at Hearst Field Annex B5 on Monday from 8-10 PM (Fall 2024), excepting days when there is no class. Anyone is welcome to drop in! We also have a discord, which we use for communication. Sometimes we talk about club logistics, but we mostly just cube. Official membership is reserved for UC Berkeley students and alumni.\nTo know what our events/competitions are during the semester, you can find them on our calendar link.\nAll our communication is through Discord. If you have any questions, please ask us there! We\u0026rsquo;re still a very active club, so we\u0026rsquo;ll respond very quickly there.\nIn case you don\u0026rsquo;t have Discord, feel free to contact us at berkeleycubeclub@gmail.com for any questions.\nPhoto from our Cube Club Retreat We are a student group acting independently of the University of California.
